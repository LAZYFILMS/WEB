<body>
    <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
    <p>At Lazy Films Lab, we strive to provide the best possible experience for our customers. However, due to the nature of film processing services, we have specific guidelines for refunds and cancellations.</p>
    
    <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
    <p>Orders can only be canceled before the film has been received and processing has begun. Once processing has started, cancellations will not be possible.</p>

    <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If an order is canceled before processing begins.</li>
        <li>If we are unable to process the film due to technical issues on our end.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Refund Processing Time:</strong> Refunds will be processed within <strong>7-10 business days</strong> and credited to the original payment method.</p>

    <p>For any refund-related queries, contact us at <a href="mailto:thelazyfilmmaker97@gmail.com">thelazyfilmmaker97@gmail.com</a>.</p>
